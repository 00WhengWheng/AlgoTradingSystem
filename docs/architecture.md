# System Architecture

## Overview
This trading algorithm system is designed to fetch market data, preprocess it, engineer features, train and evaluate models, and perform backtesting on various trading strategies. Below is an overview of the primary components and their interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Acquisition
- **Folder**: `src/data/scripts`
- **Description**: Handles fetching historical market data from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) and stores it in a structured format.
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `fetch_data.py`
  - `preprocess_data.py`

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Folder**: `src/features`
- **Description**: Applies technical indicators, custom features, and normalization techniques to the data.
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `technical_indicators.py`
  - `custom_features.py`
  - `feature_scaling.py`

### 3. Models
- **Folder**: `src/models`
- **Description**: Manages training, saving, and loading of machine learning models.
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `model_trainer.py`
  - `model_evaluator.py`

### 4. Backtesting
- **Folder**: `src/backtesting`
- **Description**: Runs backtests on trading strategies using historical data and calculates performance metrics.
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `backtester.py`
  - `performance_metrics.py`

### 5. Strategies
- **Folder**: `src/strategies`
- **Description**: Contains implementations of individual trading strategies.
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `moving_average_crossover.py`
  - `mean_reversion.py`

### 6. Utilities
- **Folder**: `src/utils`
- **Description**: Helper functions for configuration loading, logging, database connections, and data utilities.

*Include a flowchart or diagram here if applicable, showing data flow through the components (e.g., from data acquisition to feature engineering, model training, and backtesting).*

## Deployment
This system is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging services such as Cloud Storage for data, AI Platform for model deployment, and Kubernetes Engine for scaling.
